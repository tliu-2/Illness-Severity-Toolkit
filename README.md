# Illness Severity Toolkit
This program presents a user interface for calculating illness severity scores on a patient
population given clinical parameters. The algorithms that are either illness severity scores
or related to illness severity which are implemented in the program are:
- Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III)
- Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
- Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
- Ventilator Free Days (VFDs)
- Oxygenation Index (OI)

The APACHE III is implemented per the specifications in:  
Knaus WA, Wagner DP, Draper EA, Zimmerman JE, Bergner M, Bastos PG, Sirio CA, Murphy DJ, Lotring T, Damiano A, et al.
The APACHE III prognostic system. Risk prediction of hospital mortality for critically ill hospitalized adults. Chest. 1991 Dec;100(6):1619-36. doi: 10.1378/chest.100.6.1619. PMID: 1959406.
